steps: 1. Selection of reference standards with known values to cover the range of interest. 2. Measurements on the reference standards with the instrument to be calibrated. 3. Functional relationship between the measured and known values of the reference standards (usually a least-squares fit to the data) called a calibration curve. 4. Correction of all measurements by the inverse of the calibration curve},

abstract = {Lower cost sensors ({\$}100-500) represent a unique class of air monitoring devices which may provide for more ubiquitous pollutant monitoring. They vary widely in design and measure pollutants ranging from ozone, particulate matter, to volatile organic compounds, among others. Many of these sensors provide for continuous air quality measurements and wireless data transmission. However, data quality from such devices is a concern. Three straw-man approaches to improve upon the usability of such measurements were considered as part of the 2013 Air Sensors Workshop. Findings from the breakout devoted to this topic are summarized. The 2013 Air Sensors Workshop had a primary goal of moving past previous expert discussions on discovery of low cost sensor technologies (1,2) and how data from such sensors could be used to their full advantage. One key concern about these technologies was the uncertainty of their data in that often no direct means of sensor calibration was being provided by the sensor developer. As explained further in this article, there are a multitude of reasons for this lack of what most monitoring experts would consider to be a necessary feature of any air quality sensor (user response calibration). This leaves the user (often private citizens with no scientific training) with collecting data which may or may not be accurate or even realistic. To help frame a discussion about this concern and how it might be resolved, three straw-man calibration approaches were developed prior to the workshop. They were provided to registrants in advance for their consideration. Subsequent breakout panels consisting of more than 40 experts having backgrounds in sensor development, environmental monitoring, regulatory affairs, data signal processing, or citizen science then critically examined each straw-man approach. The value of each approach was considered and summary conclusions established based upon the likelihood of success of each approach and/or its acceptance by the lower cost sensor user community. Key features of each approach are defined in Table 1 and discussed in depth below.},

abstract = {This Air Sensor Guidebook has been developed by the U.S. EPA to assist those interested in potentially using lower cost air quality sensor technologies for air quality measurements. Its development was in direct response to a request for such a document following a recent scientific conference (Apps and Sensors for Air Pollution-2012). Low cost air quality sensors ({\$}100-{\$}2500) are now commercially available in a wide variety of designs and capabilities. This is an emerging technology area and one that is quickly evolving. Even so, their availability has resulted in questions from many as to how they might be used appropriately. This document attempts to provide useful information concerning some of those questions. The use of sensors to meet a variety of needs ranging from educational programs to professional research data collections is described. A select market survey is provided here to inform the reader about the cost range and performance capability of commercially available air quality sensors. The document provides background information on common air pollutants such as those defined as “criteria pollutants” as well as select others. Useful information is provided in the guidebook relative to key considerations about selecting the most appropriate sensor for one's need concerning these pollutants. Professional air quality researchers are trained to look for various attributes in monitoring technologies. While this document is limited in its scope concerning this area, basic information is provided that should assist citizen scientists and others in making the most appropriate choices. A major component of this guidebook is a discussion about data quality D considerations. Such topics as the need to calibrate sensors, determining the precision of the device's response, its response bias, and other performance characteristics are explained in practical terms. Examples of such performance characteristics determinations are provided to assist the user in understanding these important concepts. This guidebook does not attempt to answer every question the U.S. EPA has received about the selection and use of various sensor technologies. Sensor use must be considered on an individual basis and only following careful consideration of why the data is being collected and for what purpose. Extensive resources, nearly all easily obtained free through the internet, are highlighted in the document to assist potential sensor users in obtaining useful information as they consider the incorporation of sensor technology to meet a variety of applications.},
