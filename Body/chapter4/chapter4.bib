steps: 1. Selection of reference standards with known values to cover the range of interest. 2. Measurements on the reference standards with the instrument to be calibrated. 3. Functional relationship between the measured and known values of the reference standards (usually a least-squares fit to the data) called a calibration curve. 4. Correction of all measurements by the inverse of the calibration curve},

abstract = {Lower cost sensors ({\$}100-500) represent a unique class of air monitoring devices which may provide for more ubiquitous pollutant monitoring. They vary widely in design and measure pollutants ranging from ozone, particulate matter, to volatile organic compounds, among others. Many of these sensors provide for continuous air quality measurements and wireless data transmission. However, data quality from such devices is a concern. Three straw-man approaches to improve upon the usability of such measurements were considered as part of the 2013 Air Sensors Workshop. Findings from the breakout devoted to this topic are summarized. The 2013 Air Sensors Workshop had a primary goal of moving past previous expert discussions on discovery of low cost sensor technologies (1,2) and how data from such sensors could be used to their full advantage. One key concern about these technologies was the uncertainty of their data in that often no direct means of sensor calibration was being provided by the sensor developer. As explained further in this article, there are a multitude of reasons for this lack of what most monitoring experts would consider to be a necessary feature of any air quality sensor (user response calibration). This leaves the user (often private citizens with no scientific training) with collecting data which may or may not be accurate or even realistic. To help frame a discussion about this concern and how it might be resolved, three straw-man calibration approaches were developed prior to the workshop. They were provided to registrants in advance for their consideration. Subsequent breakout panels consisting of more than 40 experts having backgrounds in sensor development, environmental monitoring, regulatory affairs, data signal processing, or citizen science then critically examined each straw-man approach. The value of each approach was considered and summary conclusions established based upon the likelihood of success of each approach and/or its acceptance by the lower cost sensor user community. Key features of each approach are defined in Table 1 and discussed in depth below.},
