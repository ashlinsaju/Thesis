abstract = {Lower cost sensors ({\$}100-500) represent a unique class of air monitoring devices which may provide for more ubiquitous pollutant monitoring. They vary widely in design and measure pollutants ranging from ozone, particulate matter, to volatile organic compounds, among others. Many of these sensors provide for continuous air quality measurements and wireless data transmission. However, data quality from such devices is a concern. Three straw-man approaches to improve upon the usability of such measurements were considered as part of the 2013 Air Sensors Workshop. Findings from the breakout devoted to this topic are summarized. The 2013 Air Sensors Workshop had a primary goal of moving past previous expert discussions on discovery of low cost sensor technologies (1,2) and how data from such sensors could be used to their full advantage. One key concern about these technologies was the uncertainty of their data in that often no direct means of sensor calibration was being provided by the sensor developer. As explained further in this article, there are a multitude of reasons for this lack of what most monitoring experts would consider to be a necessary feature of any air quality sensor (user response calibration). This leaves the user (often private citizens with no scientific training) with collecting data which may or may not be accurate or even realistic. To help frame a discussion about this concern and how it might be resolved, three straw-man calibration approaches were developed prior to the workshop. They were provided to registrants in advance for their consideration. Subsequent breakout panels consisting of more than 40 experts having backgrounds in sensor development, environmental monitoring, regulatory affairs, data signal processing, or citizen science then critically examined each straw-man approach. The value of each approach was considered and summary conclusions established based upon the likelihood of success of each approach and/or its acceptance by the lower cost sensor user community. Key features of each approach are defined in Table 1 and discussed in depth below.},

abstract = {This Air Sensor Guidebook has been developed by the U.S. EPA to assist those interested in potentially using lower cost air quality sensor technologies for air quality measurements. Its development was in direct response to a request for such a document following a recent scientific conference (Apps and Sensors for Air Pollution-2012). Low cost air quality sensors ({\$}100-{\$}2500) are now commercially available in a wide variety of designs and capabilities. This is an emerging technology area and one that is quickly evolving. Even so, their availability has resulted in questions from many as to how they might be used appropriately. This document attempts to provide useful information concerning some of those questions. The use of sensors to meet a variety of needs ranging from educational programs to professional research data collections is described. A select market survey is provided here to inform the reader about the cost range and performance capability of commercially available air quality sensors. The document provides background information on common air pollutants such as those defined as “criteria pollutants” as well as select others. Useful information is provided in the guidebook relative to key considerations about selecting the most appropriate sensor for one's need concerning these pollutants. Professional air quality researchers are trained to look for various attributes in monitoring technologies. While this document is limited in its scope concerning this area, basic information is provided that should assist citizen scientists and others in making the most appropriate choices. A major component of this guidebook is a discussion about data quality D considerations. Such topics as the need to calibrate sensors, determining the precision of the device's response, its response bias, and other performance characteristics are explained in practical terms. Examples of such performance characteristics determinations are provided to assist the user in understanding these important concepts. This guidebook does not attempt to answer every question the U.S. EPA has received about the selection and use of various sensor technologies. Sensor use must be considered on an individual basis and only following careful consideration of why the data is being collected and for what purpose. Extensive resources, nearly all easily obtained free through the internet, are highlighted in the document to assist potential sensor users in obtaining useful information as they consider the incorporation of sensor technology to meet a variety of applications.},

abstract = {The following is a summary of program uses and needs for calibration curves as integral background information to establish greater consistency across the Agency. OAR-Stationary Source/Ambient Air-Almost all of our test procedures in Parts 60, 61, and 63 use calibration curves/lines to relate instrument response to analyte concentration or mass. Many of the methods contain quality assurance requirements that the analyst must meet for the acceptability of the calibration curve. Our QA requirements have generally not relied on correlation coefficients, but have followed an approach closer to that of Dr. Burrows where the response of each calibration standard must be within a specified range of the value predicted by the calibration line. Here is a typical example taken from Method 7 for the measurement of NO x emissions from Stationary Sources. In this case the analytical procedure is spectrophotometry in the visible range. 10.1.3 Spectrophotometer Calibration Quality Control. Multiply the absorbance value obtained for each standard by the K c factor (reciprocal of the least squares slope) to determine the distance each calibration point lies from the theoretical calibration line. The difference between the calculated concentration values and the actual concentrations (i.e., 100, 200, 300, and 400 $\mu$g NO 2) should be less than 7 percent for all standards. We need a quality assurance requirement for calibration curves/lines that would insure that testers are using calibration data to generate calibration curves that meet minimum standards for "goodness of fit."

abstract = {Calibration procedure is an important part of instrumental analysis. Usually it is not the major uncertainty source in whole analytical procedure. However, improper calibration might cause a significant bias of the analytical results from the real (certified) value. Standard Gaussian line- ar regression is the most frequently used mathematical approach for esti- mation of calibration function parameters. In the present article are dis- cussed some not quite popular, but highly recommended in certain cases methods for parameter estimation, such as: weighted regression, orthogo- nal regression, robust regression, bracketing calibration etc. Some useful approximations are also presented. Special attention is paid to the statistical criteria which to be used for selection of proper calibration model. Standard UV-VIS spectrometric procedure for determination of phos- phates in water was used as a practical example. Several different ap- proaches for estimation of the contribution of calibration to the general un- certainty of the analytical result are presented and compared. 1.},

@article{Almeida2002,
abstract = {When the assumption of homoscedasticity is not met for analytical data, a simple and effective way to counteract the greater influence of the greater concentrations on the fitted regression line is to use weighted least squares linear regression (WLSLR). The purpose of the present paper is to stress the relevance of weighting schemes for linear regression analysis and to show how this approach can be useful in the bioanalytical field. The steps to be taken in the study of the linear calibration approach are described. The application of weighting schemes was shown by using a high-performance liquid chromatography method for the determination of lamotrigine in biological fluids as a practical example. By using the WLSLR, the accuracy of the analytical method was improved at the lower end of the calibration curve. Bioanalytical methods data analysis was improved by using the WLSLR procedure. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},
