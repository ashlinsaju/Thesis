abstract = {Environmental pollution in the urban areas of Hong Kong has become a serious public issue but most urban inhabitants have no means of judging their own living environment in terms of dangerous threshold and overall livability. Currently there exist many low-cost sensors such as ultra-violet, temperature and air quality sensors that provide reasonably accurate data quality. In this paper, the development and evaluation of Integrated Environmental Monitoring System (IEMS) are illustrated. This system consists of three components: (i) position determination and sensor data collection for real-time geospatial-based environmental monitoring; (ii) on-site data communication and visualization with the aid of an Android-based application; and (iii) data analysis on a web server. This system has shown to be working well during field tests in a bus journey and a construction site. It provides an effective service platform for collecting environmental data in near real-time, and raises the public awareness of environmental quality in micro-environments.},

@article{Fang2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.In the U.S., people spend approximately 90 percent of their time indoors. Unfortunately, indoor air quality (IAQ) may be two to five times worse than the air outdoors, and is often overlooked. Existing IAQ monitoring technologies focus on IAQ measurements and visualization. However, the lack of information about the pollution sources as well as the seriousness of the pollution makes people feel powerless and frustrated, resulting in the ignorance of the polluted air at their homes. In this work, we fill this critical gap by presenting AirSense, an intelligent home-based IAQ sensing system that is able to automatically detect pollution events, identify pollution sources, estimate personal exposure to indoor air pollution, and provide actionable suggestions to help people improve IAQ. We have deployed AirSense at five homes to evaluate its performance and investigate how users interact with it. We demonstrate that AirSense can accurately detect pollution events, identify pollution sources, and forecast IAQ information within five minutes in both controlled and real-world settings. We further show the great potential of AirSense in increasing users' awareness of IAQ and helping them better manage IAQ at their homes.},

@article{Dutta2017,
abstract = {Cities are expanding and more and more citizens are exposed to air pollutants both indoors and outdoors. This may have adverse effects on citizens' health. In this paper, we present AirSense, an opportunistic crowd-sensing based air quality monitoring system, aimed at collecting and aggregating sensor data to monitor air pollution in the vicinity (building/neighbourhood) and the city. We introduce a light weight, low power and low cost air quality monitoring device (AQMD) and demonstrate how AQMD and smartphones in a crowd collaboratively gather and share data of interest to the cloud. In cloud, collected data are analyzed and an aggregate view is generated from data collected from various sensors and from different users for providing an air pollution heat map of the city. Unlike previous works, both micro and macro level air quality monitoring is possible with Airsense. End user can view his/her pollution footprint for the whole day, the neighborhood (local) air quality and AQImap (air quality index map) of the city on his/her smartphone. The system is implemented and the prototype is also evaluated.},

abstract = {In 2012, air pollution in both cities and rural areas was esti- mated to have caused 3.7 million premature deaths, 88{\%} of those in at-risk communities. The primary pollutant was small airborne particulate matter of 10 microns or less in diameter, which led to the development of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. In response, we developed MyPart, the first personal, portable, and accurate particle sensor under {\$}50 capable of distinguishing and counting differently sized particles. We demonstrate how MyPart offers substantial enhancements over most existing air particle sensors by simultaneously improving accessibility, flexibility, portability, and accuracy. We de- scribe the evolution and implementation of the sensor design, demonstrate its performance across twenty everyday urban environments versus a calibrated instrument, and conduct a preliminary user study to report on the overall user experience of MyPart. We also present a novel smart-phone visualization interface and a series of simple form factor adaptations of our design.},

@article{McKercher2017,
abstract = {Background Traditional approaches for measuring air quality based on fixed measurements are inadequate for personal exposure monitoring. To combat this issue, the use of small, portable gas-sensing air pollution monitoring technologies is increasing, with researchers and individuals employing portable and mobile methods to obtain more spatially and temporally representative air pollution data. However, many commercially available options are built for various applications and based on different technologies, assumptions, and limitations. A review of the monitor characteristics of small, gaseous monitors is missing from current scientific literature. Purpose A state-of-the-art review of small, portable monitors that measure ambient gaseous outdoor pollutants was developed to address broad trends during the last 5–10 years, and to help future experimenters interested in studying gaseous air pollutants choose monitors appropriate for their application and sampling needs. Methods Trends in small, portable gaseous air pollution monitor uses and technologies were first identified and discussed in a review of literature. Next, searches of online databases were performed for articles containing specific information related to performance, characteristics, and use of such monitors that measure one or more of three criteria gaseous air pollutants: ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide. All data were summarized into reference tables for comparison between applications, physical features, sensing capabilities, and costs of the devices. Results Recent portable monitoring trends are strongly related to associated applications and audiences. Fundamental research requires monitors with the best individual performance, and thus the highest cost technology. Monitor networking favors real-time capabilities and moderate cost for greater reproduction. Citizen science and crowdsourcing applications allow for lower-cost components; however important strengths and limitations for each application must be addressed or acknowledged for the given use.},

In this paper, we formulate the Bus Sensor Deployment Problem (BSDP) to select the bus routes on which sensors are deployed, and we use Chemical Reaction Optimization (CRO) to solve BSDP. CRO is a recently proposed metaheuristic designed to solve a wide range of optimization problems. Using the real world data, namely Hong Kong Island bus route data, we perform a series of simulations and the results show that CRO is capable of solving this optimization problem efficiently.},
