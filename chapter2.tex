\chapter{Literature Survey}

One of the greatest innovation in the field of electronics was the development of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN ) which paved the way for various research works. The miniaturization of the components has allowed the user to experiment in various field of science such as health care, military applications, traffic control, monitoring, data collection \cite{Khedo2017} \cite{Liu2017}. Out of these air pollution monitoring has gained a lot of attention.  One of the major issues faced by the society is about the urban air quality. Air pollution is conventionally monitored by stationary devices that gives reliable and accurate data. The main issue with these system is their cost and large size.
