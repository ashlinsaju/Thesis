\section*{Design and Implementation of Air Pollution Monitoring System}

The advancement in technology has made it easy for researchers to explore more in different areas. One such development is in the area of sensor technology which completey changes the outlook to different application level problems. In this chapter, I share my hands on experience in the development, design, integration and operation of the air pollution system. Earlier approach of understanding air pollution used complex and stationary equipments which collects data but things have changed after the low cost, easy to use, portable sensors came in markets.
