Their widespread use has caused health problems and fatalities in many parts of the world, often as a result of occupational exposure and accidental or intentional poisonings. Environmental contamination can also result in human exposure through consumption of residues of pesticides in food and, possibly, drinking-water. Although developed countries have sophisticated systems already in place to register pesticides and control their trade and use, this is not always the case elsewhere. Guidance and legal frameworks on the use, management and trade of pesticides—including highly hazardous pesticides—as well as proper storage and handling are available from international organizations and international conventions; these should be implemented globally.},

It is possible that these advances can support traditional air quality monitoring by supplementing ambient air monitoring and enhancing compliance monitoring. Sensors are beginning to provide individuals and communities the tools needed to understand their environmental exposures with these data individual and community-based strategies can be developed to reduce pollution exposure as well as understand linkages to health indicators. Each of these areas as well as corresponding challenges (e.g., quality of data) and potential opportunities associated with development and implementation of air pollution sensors are discussed.},

abstract = {Inexpensive aerosol sensors have been considered as a complementary option to address the issue of expensive but low spatial coverage air quality monitoring networks. However, the accuracy and response characteristics of these sensors is poorly documented. In this study, inexpensive Shinyei PPD42NS and PPD60PV sensors were evaluated using a novel laboratory evaluation method. A continuously changing monodisperse size distribution of particles was generated using a Vibrating Orifice Aerosol Generator. Furthermore, the laboratory results were validated in a field experiment. The laboratory tests showed that both of the sensors responded to particulate mass (PM) concentration stimulus, rather than number concentration. The highest detection efficiency for the PPD42NS was within particle size range of 2.5–4 m, and the respective optimal size range for the PPD60PV was 0.7–1 m. The field test yielded high PM correlations (R2 = 0.962 and R2 = 0.986) for viable detection ranges of 1.6–5 and 0.3–1.6 m, when compared to a medium cost optical dust monitor. As the size distribution of atmospheric particles tends to be bimodal, it is likely that indicatively valid results could be obtained for the PM10–2.5 size fraction (particulate mass in size range 2.5–10 m) with the PPD42NS sensor. Respectively, the PPD60PV could possibly be used to measure the PM2.5 size fraction (particulate mass in size below 2.5 m).},

abstract = {Lower cost sensors ({\$}100-500) represent a unique class of air monitoring devices which may provide for more ubiquitous pollutant monitoring. They vary widely in design and measure pollutants ranging from ozone, particulate matter, to volatile organic compounds, among others. Many of these sensors provide for continuous air quality measurements and wireless data transmission. However, data quality from such devices is a concern. Three straw-man approaches to improve upon the usability of such measurements were considered as part of the 2013 Air Sensors Workshop. Findings from the breakout devoted to this topic are summarized. The 2013 Air Sensors Workshop had a primary goal of moving past previous expert discussions on discovery of low cost sensor technologies (1,2) and how data from such sensors could be used to their full advantage. One key concern about these technologies was the uncertainty of their data in that often no direct means of sensor calibration was being provided by the sensor developer. As explained further in this article, there are a multitude of reasons for this lack of what most monitoring experts would consider to be a necessary feature of any air quality sensor (user response calibration). This leaves the user (often private citizens with no scientific training) with collecting data which may or may not be accurate or even realistic. To help frame a discussion about this concern and how it might be resolved, three straw-man calibration approaches were developed prior to the workshop. They were provided to registrants in advance for their consideration. Subsequent breakout panels consisting of more than 40 experts having backgrounds in sensor development, environmental monitoring, regulatory affairs, data signal processing, or citizen science then critically examined each straw-man approach. The value of each approach was considered and summary conclusions established based upon the likelihood of success of each approach and/or its acceptance by the lower cost sensor user community. Key features of each approach are defined in Table 1 and discussed in depth below.},

abstract = {This Air Sensor Guidebook has been developed by the U.S. EPA to assist those interested in potentially using lower cost air quality sensor technologies for air quality measurements. Its development was in direct response to a request for such a document following a recent scientific conference (Apps and Sensors for Air Pollution-2012). Low cost air quality sensors ({\$}100-{\$}2500) are now commercially available in a wide variety of designs and capabilities. This is an emerging technology area and one that is quickly evolving. Even so, their availability has resulted in questions from many as to how they might be used appropriately. This document attempts to provide useful information concerning some of those questions. The use of sensors to meet a variety of needs ranging from educational programs to professional research data collections is described. A select market survey is provided here to inform the reader about the cost range and performance capability of commercially available air quality sensors. The document provides background information on common air pollutants such as those defined as “criteria pollutants” as well as select others. Useful information is provided in the guidebook relative to key considerations about selecting the most appropriate sensor for one's need concerning these pollutants. Professional air quality researchers are trained to look for various attributes in monitoring technologies. While this document is limited in its scope concerning this area, basic information is provided that should assist citizen scientists and others in making the most appropriate choices. A major component of this guidebook is a discussion about data quality D considerations. Such topics as the need to calibrate sensors, determining the precision of the device's response, its response bias, and other performance characteristics are explained in practical terms. Examples of such performance characteristics determinations are provided to assist the user in understanding these important concepts. This guidebook does not attempt to answer every question the U.S. EPA has received about the selection and use of various sensor technologies. Sensor use must be considered on an individual basis and only following careful consideration of why the data is being collected and for what purpose. Extensive resources, nearly all easily obtained free through the internet, are highlighted in the document to assist potential sensor users in obtaining useful information as they consider the incorporation of sensor technology to meet a variety of applications.},

OAR-Stationary Source/Ambient Air-Almost all of our test procedures in Parts 60, 61, and 63 use calibration curves/lines to relate instrument response to analyte concentration or mass. Many of the methods contain quality assurance requirements that the analyst must meet for the acceptability of the calibration curve. Our QA requirements have generally not relied on correlation coefficients, but have followed an approach closer to that of Dr. Burrows where the response of each calibration standard must be within a specified range of the value predicted by the calibration line. Here is a typical example taken from Method 7 for the measurement of NO x emissions from Stationary Sources. In this case the analytical procedure is spectrophotometry in the visible range. 10.1.3 Spectrophotometer Calibration Quality Control. Multiply the absorbance value obtained for each standard by the K c factor (reciprocal of the least squares slope) to determine the distance each calibration point lies from the theoretical calibration line. The difference between the calculated concentration values and the actual concentrations (i.e., 100, 200, 300, and 400 $\mu$g NO 2) should be less than 7 percent for all standards. We need a quality assurance requirement for calibration curves/lines that would insure that testers are using calibration data to generate calibration curves that meet minimum standards for "goodness of fit."

The purpose of the present paper is to stress the relevance of weighting schemes for linear regression analysis and to show how this approach can be useful in the bioanalytical field. The steps to be taken in the study of the linear calibration approach are described. The application of weighting schemes was shown by using a high-performance liquid chromatography method for the determination of lamotrigine in biological fluids as a practical example. By using the WLSLR, the accuracy of the analytical method was improved at the lower end of the calibration curve. Bioanalytical methods data analysis was improved by using the WLSLR procedure. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) along with state, local, and tribal governments operate Federal Reference Method (FRM) and Federal Equivalent Method (FEM) instruments to assess compliance with US air pollution standards designed to protect human and ecosystem health. As the technological foundation of air pollution monitoring advances, new capabilities are being developed which can enhance our ability to determine ambient air pollutant concentrations. A new category of air pollution monitoring instruments called 'sensors' have emerged with a number of implications for the current US air monitoring strategy. Sensors have the potential to be used in compliance monitoring, however a number of considerations must be addressed. Fortunately EPA's FEM Program, under the 40 CFR Part 53 regulations, provides a clear roadmap for upgrading air pollution monitoring devices and this guidance can be applied to sensors. The paper will discuss how new technology is integrated into EPA's air monitoring program and how EPA's regulations can be used to incorporate sensors into the US air monitoring network.},

@article{Tian2016,
abstract = {In 2012, air pollution in both cities and rural areas was esti- mated to have caused 3.7 million premature deaths, 88{\%} of those in at-risk communities. The primary pollutant was small airborne particulate matter of 10 microns or less in diameter, which led to the development of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. In response, we developed MyPart, the first personal, portable, and accurate particle sensor under {\$}50 capable of distinguishing and counting differently sized particles. We demonstrate how MyPart offers substantial enhancements over most existing air particle sensors by simultaneously improving accessibility, flexibility, portability, and accuracy. We de- scribe the evolution and implementation of the sensor design, demonstrate its performance across twenty everyday urban environments versus a calibrated instrument, and conduct a preliminary user study to report on the overall user experience of MyPart. We also present a novel smart-phone visualization interface and a series of simple form factor adaptations of our design.},

(VOCs), ozone (O3), heavy metals, and respirable particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), differ in their chemical composition, reaction properties,
emission, time of disintegration and ability to diffuse in long or short distances. Air pollution has both acute and chronic effects on human
health, affecting a number of different systems and organs. It ranges from minor upper respiratory irritation to chronic respiratory and heart
disease, lung cancer, acute respiratory infections in children and chronic bronchitis in adults, aggravating pre-existing heart and lung disease,

abstract = {With the rapid increase in numbers of private vehicles on the road, many transportation related issues like congestion, crashes and injuries, pollution, noise etc. have grown very rapidly. Urban settlements like core CBD and heritage town, which were planned for NMT and pedestrians, are worst affected. Environment, in such areas, has degraded to the extent that people do not wish to visit these areas anymore. On another hand, these areas have very significant role in economy and identity of the city. Due to unavailability of space and socioeconomic system, only feasible way to upgrade mobility and environment in such special areas is to pedestrianize them. Pedestrianization of the congested street is a very effective, low-cost and sustainable solution. Other than congestion reduction, Pedestrianization has numerous benefits. These list of benefits can be used to advocate Pedestrianization of any street. It can also help in estimating the cost to benefit ratio of such schemes. The first part of this paper summarize various benefits of Pedestrianization from the experience of Pedestrianization scheme around the globe and various researches conducted on its impact. These Benefits can be separated in various categories based on impacts on Transportation, Society, Environment, Economics, and Health. The second part of the paper list down various warrants that can be used as the indicators for the need of Pedestrianization in an area. These warrants can also be used as justification to pedestrianize an area. This paper will help various urban policy makers, land-use and transportation planner, environmentalists and citizens etc. in decision making to solve various urban issues related to transportation.},

A multi-parameter algorithm was used to correct for the impact of environmental conditions on the electrochemical sensors for carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollutants. The field evaluation in an urban roadside environment in comparison to designated monitors showed good agreement with measurement error within 5{\%} of the pollutant concentrations. Multiple sets of the developed system were then deployed in the Hong Kong Marathon 2015 forming a sensor-based network along the marathon route. Real-time air pollution concentration data were wirelessly transmitted and the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) for the Green Marathon was calculated, which were broadcast to the public on an hourly basis. The route-specific sensor network showed somewhat different pollutant patterns than routine air monitoring, indicating the immediate impact of traffic control during the marathon on the roadside air quality. The study is one of the first applications of a next generation sensor network in international sport events, and it demonstrated the usefulness of the emerging sensor-based air monitoring technology in rapid network deployment to supplement existing air monitoring.},

abstract = {Urban air pollution is a major concern in many cities worldwide. Atmospheric pollutants are responsible for health problems ranging from asthma to cancer. Air pollution also causes environmental damages. Monitoring airborne pollutants is of utmost importance to reliably assess the impact of air pollution on the human health, enable urban planners to craft and accurately evaluate new policies, and increase public awareness. Nowadays, air pollution is monitored by networks of highly accurate but fixed measurement stations. Hence, the gathered data has a low spatial resolution and can not be used to assess the spatial variability of pollutants in detail. As a result, little is known about the spatial distribution of air pollutants in urban environments. In this thesis, we tackle this challenge and derive fine-grained intraurban pollution maps valuable for a range of applications. We use compact low-cost sensors installed on top of public transport vehicles to obtain a high spatial measurement resolution within a large urban area. We develop algorithms that allow us to accurately monitor the phenomena of interest despite using noisy, low-cost sensors. Finally, we use the measurements to derive air pollution maps with a high spatial and temporal resolution},

abstract = {The air quality in urban areas is a major concern in modern cities due to significant impacts of air pollution on public health, global environment, and worldwide economy. Recent studies reveal the importance of micro-level pollution information, including human personal exposure and acute exposure to air pollutants. A real-time system with high spatio-temporal resolution is essential because of the limited data availability and non-scalability of conventional air pollution monitoring systems. Currently, researchers focus on the concept of The Next Generation Air Pollution Monitoring System (TNGAPMS) and have achieved significant breakthroughs by utilizing the advance sensing technologies, MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). However, there exist potential problems of these newly proposed systems, namely the lack of 3D data acquisition ability and the flexibility of the sensor network. In this paper, we classify the existing works into three categories as Static Sensor Network (SSN), Community Sensor Network (CSN) and Vehicle Sensor Network (VSN) based on the carriers of the sensors. Comprehensive reviews and comparisons among these three types of sensor networks were also performed. Last but not least, we discuss the limitations of the existing works and conclude the objectives that we want to achieve in future systems.},

abstract = {Air pollution is evolving as a severe environmental concern due to its enormous impact on the well being of the people, universal environment and also on the global economy. Conventional air pollution systems are not able to provide air pollution data of high spatiotemporal resolution due to non-scalability and limited data availability. With the advances in the areas of Micro Electro Mechanical Sensor (MEMS) and Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), the researchers proposed various state-of-the-art air pollution monitoring systems for measuring major air pollutants like CO 2 , CO, O 3 , SO 2 , VOC and Particulate Matter (PM) with better results. A comprehensive review of continuous air pollution surveillance of both indoor and outdoor pollution by employing WSN is presented. It presents the various techniques and algorithms employed in the design of dedicated air pollution monitoring systems using WSN. A comprehensive and detailed review of the existing methods of Air Quality Monitoring systems using WSN is done along with their comparisons.},

abstract = {This paper considers a micro-climate monitoring scenario, which usually requires deploying a large number of sensor nodes to capture environmental information. By exploiting vehicular sensor networks (VSNs), it is possible to equip fewer nodes on cars to achieve fine-grained monitoring. Specifically, when a car is moving, it could conduct measurements at different locations, thus collecting lots of sensing data. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a VSN architecture to collect and measure air quality for micro-climate monitoring in city areas, where nodes' mobility may be uncontrollable (such as taxis). In the proposed VSN architecture, we address two network-related issues: (1) how to adaptively adjust the reporting rates of mobile nodes to satisfy a target monitoring quality with less communication overhead and (2) how to exploit opportunistic communications to reduce message transmissions. We propose algorithms to solve these two issues and verify their performances by simulations. In addition, we also develop a ZigBee-based prototype to monitor the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas in city areas. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

With the advancements in technology, several innovations have been made in the field of communications that are transitioning to the Internet of Things (IoT). In this domain, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are one of those independent sensing devices to monitor physical and environmental conditions along with thousands of applications in other fields. In this paper, we are proposing the deployment of WSN sensor nodes in public transport buses for the constant monitoring of air pollution. The data regarding the air pollution particles such as emissions, smoke, and other pollutants will be collected via sensors on the public transport bus and the data will be aggregated and transmitted to the nearest sink node. Using the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) the collected data will be uploaded on the cloud server also called as the IoT cloud where a large amount of the data is stored. This data can then be accessed at any point to analyze and accurate measures can be taken to map the air pollution},

abstract = {Air quality and pollution monitoring services are provided by many countries and cities. However, individuals are more concerned about personal exposure and dosage, which can rarely be estimated due to the low spatial resolution of air pollution data and lack of personal data. In recent years, an increasing number of research groups, including ours, have focused on increasing the spatial resolution of air pollution data using ubiquitous sensor networks. These works did raise the spatial granularity compared with data from fixed air pollution monitoring sites. In this paper, we combine air pollution and human energy expenditure data to give individuals real-time personal air pollution exposure estimates. In particular, this paper describes our experiences with developing a personal air pollution exposure estimation system utilising participatory air pollution monitoring system and energy expenditure data collected from wearable activity sensors. Our system and applications will benefit the understanding of the relationship between air pollution exposure and personal health. We also conducted a trial to get a full day's air pollution inhalation dosage for one participant, and applied multiple data mining techniques to find out associations between activity mode, location, and the inhaled pollution. Results show that sleep, having meals, working in a campus, and general home activities like reading books will lead to a low air pollution dosage, while working out, walking and driving will cause higher inhaled dose. Furthermore, classification results in our study based on activity modes, locations and dosage data which is collected in the trial show that up to 94{\%} classification accuracy can be achieved.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.In the U.S., people spend approximately 90 percent of their time indoors. Unfortunately, indoor air quality (IAQ) may be two to five times worse than the air outdoors, and is often overlooked. Existing IAQ monitoring technologies focus on IAQ measurements and visualization. However, the lack of information about the pollution sources as well as the seriousness of the pollution makes people feel powerless and frustrated, resulting in the ignorance of the polluted air at their homes. In this work, we fill this critical gap by presenting AirSense, an intelligent home-based IAQ sensing system that is able to automatically detect pollution events, identify pollution sources, estimate personal exposure to indoor air pollution, and provide actionable suggestions to help people improve IAQ. We have deployed AirSense at five homes to evaluate its performance and investigate how users interact with it. We demonstrate that AirSense can accurately detect pollution events, identify pollution sources, and forecast IAQ information within five minutes in both controlled and real-world settings. We further show the great potential of AirSense in increasing users' awareness of IAQ and helping them better manage IAQ at their homes.},

Five types of methods were identified: (1) methods using (physical) activity types; (2) methods based on energy expenditure, METs (metabolic equivalents of task) and oxygen consumption; (3) methods based on heart rate or (4) breathing rate; and (5) methods that combine heart and breathing rate. Methods were compared using a real-life dataset of 122 adults who wore devices to track movement, black carbon air pollution and physiological health markers for three weeks in three European cities. Different methods to estimate minute ventilation performed well in relative terms with high correlations among different methods....},

abstract = {Human exposure to specific environmental factors (e.g. air quality, lighting, and sound) is known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of many chronic diseases (e.g. asthma) and mental health disorders (e.g. anxiety). However, conventional fixed environmental monitoring stations are sparsely located and, despite environmental models, cannot adequately assess individual exposure levels. New forms of low-cost portable monitors have begun to emerge that enable the collection of higher spatial density “crowd sourced” data; however, the first generation of these low-cost environmental monitors have generally not been suitable for clinical environmental health studies due to practical challenges such as calibration, reproducibility, form factor, and battery life. In this paper, we present a wearable environmental monitor that overcomes these challenges and can be used in clinical studies The new device, called “Eco-Mini,” can be used without a smart phone and is capable of locally sampling and recording a variety of environmental parameters (Ozone, Sulfur Dioxide, Volatile Organic Compounds, humidity, temperature, ambient light color balance, and sound level) as well as individual activity (3-axis accelerometer) and location (GPS).

These systems have shown remarkable improvement in spatial granularity over government-operated monitoring systems, leading to better mapping and understanding of urban air pollution, at relatively low cost. In this paper we extend the paradigm to personalize the consumption of data by individuals. Specifically, we combine the pollution concentrations obtained from participatory systems with the individuals on-body activity monitors to estimate the personal inhalation dosage of air pollution. We show that the individuals activity, such as jogging, cycling, or driving, impacts their dosage, and develop an app that gives them this personalised information.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ventilatory compensation point (VCP) is an exercise threshold which has been used in the design of training programs in sports medicine and rehabilitation. We recently demonstrated that changes in the slope of the minute ventilation to heart rate relationship ($\Delta$V˙E/$\Delta$HR) can be utilized for estimation of the VCP during incremental exercise at sea level (SL). We hypothesized that in hypoxic conditions, such as high altitude (HA), VCP can be also reliably estimated by $\Delta$V˙E/$\Delta$HR.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: At SL and on immediate ascent to HA (5,050 m), six healthy subjects (42 ± 14 SD years) performed a maximal incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer; O2 uptake (V˙O2), CO2 output (V˙CO2), V˙E, and HR were measured breath-by-breath. The $\Delta$V˙E/$\Delta$HR method for VCP estimation was compared to the standard method using the ventilatory equivalent for CO2 (V˙E/V˙CO2) and end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2). The $\Delta$V˙E/$\Delta$HR slope values below (S1) and above (S2) VCP were computed by linear regression analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A significant difference between S1 and S2 was observed, at SL and HA, for both the $\Delta$V˙E/$\Delta$HR and V˙E/V˙CO2 methods for VCP estimation. A good agreement between the two methods ($\Delta$V˙E/$\Delta$HR vs. V˙E/V˙CO2) was found for both environmental conditions; the mean difference ± 2 SD of V˙O2 at VCP (VCP-V˙O2) was -22 ± 112 ml/min at SL and 39 ± 81 ml/min at HA. The VCP-V˙O2 was significantly lower at HA compared to SL; in addition, S1 and S2 mean values were significantly higher at HA compared to SL.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: At HA, VCP may be reliably estimated by the $\Delta$V˙E/$\Delta$HR method.},

@article{Kanhere2013,
abstract = {The recent wave of sensor-rich, Internet-enabled, smart mobile devices such as the Apple iPhone has opened the door for a novel paradigm for monitoring the urban landscape known as participatory sensing. Using this paradigm, ordinary citizens can collect multi-modal data streams from the surrounding environment using their mobile devices and share the same using existing communication infrastructure (e.g., 3G service or WiFi access points). The data contributed from multiple participants can be combined to build a spatiotemporal view of the phenomenon of interest and also to extract important community statistics. Given the ubiquity of mobile phones and the high density of people in metropolitan areas, participatory sensing can achieve an unprecedented level of coverage in both space and time for observing events of interest in urban spaces. Several exciting participatory sensing applications have emerged in recent years. For example, GPS traces uploaded by drivers and passengers can be used to generate real time traffic statistics. Similarly, street-level audio samples collected by pedestrians can be aggregated to create a citywide noise map. In this advanced seminar, we will provide a comprehensive overview of this new and exciting paradigm and outline the major research challenges.},

@article{Liao2006,
abstract = {Spatial estimations are increasingly used to estimate geocoded ambient particulate matter (PM) concentrations in epidemiologic studies because measures of daily PM concentrations are unavailable in most U.S. locations. This study was conducted to a) assess the feasibility of large-scale kriging estimations of daily residential-level ambient PM concentrations, b) perform and compare cross-validations of different kriging models, c) contrast three popular kriging approaches, and d) calculate SE of the kriging estimations. We used PM data for PM with aerodynamic diameter {\textless}/= 10 microm (PM10) and aerodynamic diameter {\textless}/= 2.5 microm (PM2.5) from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the year 2000. Kriging estimations were performed at 94,135 geocoded addresses of Women's Health Initiative study participants using the ArcView geographic information system. We developed a semiautomated program to enable large-scale daily kriging estimation and assessed validity of semivariogram models using prediction error (PE) , standardized prediction error (SPE) , root mean square standardized (RMSS) , and SE of the estimated PM. National- and regional-scale kriging performed satisfactorily, with the former slightly better. The average PE, SPE, and RMSS of daily PM10 semivariograms using regular ordinary kriging with a spherical model were 0.0629, -0.0011, and 1.255 microg/m3, respectively ; the average SE of the estimated residential-level PM10 was 27.36 microg/m3. The values for PM2.5 were 0.049, 0.0085, 1.389, and 4.13 microg/m3, respectively. Lognormal ordinary kriging yielded a smaller average SE and effectively eliminated out-of-range predicted values compared to regular ordinary kriging. Semiautomated daily kriging estimations and semivariogram cross-validations are feasible on a national scale. Lognormal ordinary kriging with a spherical model is valid for estimating daily ambient PM at geocoded residential addresses.},

@article{Sivaraman2013,
abstract = {—This paper describes our experiences with building and deploying a low-cost participatory system for urban air pollution monitoring in Sydney. Though air pollution imposes significant health costs on the urban community globally, to-day's published data on pollution concentrations is spatially too sparse, and does not allow for sufficiently accurate estimation of exposures for (potentially mobile) individuals in order to make medical inferences. The HazeWatch project described in this paper uses several low-cost mobile sensor units attached to vehicles to measure air pollution concentrations, and users' mobile phones to tag and upload the data in real time. The greater spatial granularity of data thus collected enables creation of pollution maps of metropolitan Sydney viewable in real-time over the web, as well as personalized apps that show the individual's exposure history and allow for route planning to reduce future exposure. We share the insights we obtained from building and trialling such a system in Sydney, and highlight challenges that can be addressed collaboratively by groups developing similar systems world-wide.},

Current projects exploring community sensing have paid less attention to these underlying fundamental principles.

@article{Perez2010,
abstract = {The pervasiveness of cellular phones combined with Internet connectivity, GPS embedded chips, location information, and integrated sensors provide an excellent platform to collect data about the individual and its surrounding environment. As a result, new applications have recently appeared to address large-scale societal problems as well as improve the quality of life of the individual. However, these new applications, recently called location-based services, participatory sensing, and human-centric sensing, bring many new challenges, one of them being the management of the huge amount of traffic (data) they generate. This article presents G-Sense, for Global-Sense, an architecture that integrates mobile and static wireless sensor networks in support of location-based services, participatory sensing, and human-centric sensing applications. G-Sense includes specific mechanisms to control the amount of data generated by these applications while meeting the application requirements. Furthermore, it creates a network of servers organized in a peer-to-peer architecture to address scalability and reliability issues. An example prototype application is presented along with some basic results and open research issues.},

Alternatively, wireless sensor network offers a comprehensive platform for capturing the surrounding environmental information using mobile sensing nodes, e.g., the OpenSense project [2] in Switzerland deploying air quality sensors like CO on public transports like buses and trams. The two sensing platforms are typically isolated from each other. In this paper, we build ExposureSense, a rich mobile participatory sensing infrastructure that integrates the two independent sensing paradigms. ExposureSense is able to monitor people's daily activities as well to compute a reasonable estimation of pollution exposure in their daily life. Besides using external sensor networks, ExposureSense also supports pluggable sensors (e.g., O3) to further enrich air quality data using mobile participatory sensing with smartphones.},

Vital to the success of participatory sensing applications is a high data quality. We improve measurement accuracy by (i) exploiting sensor readings near governmental measurement stations to keep sensor calibration up to date and (ii) analyzing the e ect of mobility on the accuracy of the sensor readings to give user advice on measurement execution. Finally, we show that it is feasible to use GasMobile to create collective high-resolution air pollution maps.},
