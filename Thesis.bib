Their widespread use has caused health problems and fatalities in many parts of the world, often as a result of occupational exposure and accidental or intentional poisonings. Environmental contamination can also result in human exposure through consumption of residues of pesticides in food and, possibly, drinking-water. Although developed countries have sophisticated systems already in place to register pesticides and control their trade and use, this is not always the case elsewhere. Guidance and legal frameworks on the use, management and trade of pesticides—including highly hazardous pesticides—as well as proper storage and handling are available from international organizations and international conventions; these should be implemented globally.},

It is possible that these advances can support traditional air quality monitoring by supplementing ambient air monitoring and enhancing compliance monitoring. Sensors are beginning to provide individuals and communities the tools needed to understand their environmental exposures with these data individual and community-based strategies can be developed to reduce pollution exposure as well as understand linkages to health indicators. Each of these areas as well as corresponding challenges (e.g., quality of data) and potential opportunities associated with development and implementation of air pollution sensors are discussed.},

abstract = {Inexpensive aerosol sensors have been considered as a complementary option to address the issue of expensive but low spatial coverage air quality monitoring networks. However, the accuracy and response characteristics of these sensors is poorly documented. In this study, inexpensive Shinyei PPD42NS and PPD60PV sensors were evaluated using a novel laboratory evaluation method. A continuously changing monodisperse size distribution of particles was generated using a Vibrating Orifice Aerosol Generator. Furthermore, the laboratory results were validated in a field experiment. The laboratory tests showed that both of the sensors responded to particulate mass (PM) concentration stimulus, rather than number concentration. The highest detection efficiency for the PPD42NS was within particle size range of 2.5–4 m, and the respective optimal size range for the PPD60PV was 0.7–1 m. The field test yielded high PM correlations (R2 = 0.962 and R2 = 0.986) for viable detection ranges of 1.6–5 and 0.3–1.6 m, when compared to a medium cost optical dust monitor. As the size distribution of atmospheric particles tends to be bimodal, it is likely that indicatively valid results could be obtained for the PM10–2.5 size fraction (particulate mass in size range 2.5–10 m) with the PPD42NS sensor. Respectively, the PPD60PV could possibly be used to measure the PM2.5 size fraction (particulate mass in size below 2.5 m).},

abstract = {Lower cost sensors ({\$}100-500) represent a unique class of air monitoring devices which may provide for more ubiquitous pollutant monitoring. They vary widely in design and measure pollutants ranging from ozone, particulate matter, to volatile organic compounds, among others. Many of these sensors provide for continuous air quality measurements and wireless data transmission. However, data quality from such devices is a concern. Three straw-man approaches to improve upon the usability of such measurements were considered as part of the 2013 Air Sensors Workshop. Findings from the breakout devoted to this topic are summarized. The 2013 Air Sensors Workshop had a primary goal of moving past previous expert discussions on discovery of low cost sensor technologies (1,2) and how data from such sensors could be used to their full advantage. One key concern about these technologies was the uncertainty of their data in that often no direct means of sensor calibration was being provided by the sensor developer. As explained further in this article, there are a multitude of reasons for this lack of what most monitoring experts would consider to be a necessary feature of any air quality sensor (user response calibration). This leaves the user (often private citizens with no scientific training) with collecting data which may or may not be accurate or even realistic. To help frame a discussion about this concern and how it might be resolved, three straw-man calibration approaches were developed prior to the workshop. They were provided to registrants in advance for their consideration. Subsequent breakout panels consisting of more than 40 experts having backgrounds in sensor development, environmental monitoring, regulatory affairs, data signal processing, or citizen science then critically examined each straw-man approach. The value of each approach was considered and summary conclusions established based upon the likelihood of success of each approach and/or its acceptance by the lower cost sensor user community. Key features of each approach are defined in Table 1 and discussed in depth below.},

abstract = {This Air Sensor Guidebook has been developed by the U.S. EPA to assist those interested in potentially using lower cost air quality sensor technologies for air quality measurements. Its development was in direct response to a request for such a document following a recent scientific conference (Apps and Sensors for Air Pollution-2012). Low cost air quality sensors ({\$}100-{\$}2500) are now commercially available in a wide variety of designs and capabilities. This is an emerging technology area and one that is quickly evolving. Even so, their availability has resulted in questions from many as to how they might be used appropriately. This document attempts to provide useful information concerning some of those questions. The use of sensors to meet a variety of needs ranging from educational programs to professional research data collections is described. A select market survey is provided here to inform the reader about the cost range and performance capability of commercially available air quality sensors. The document provides background information on common air pollutants such as those defined as “criteria pollutants” as well as select others. Useful information is provided in the guidebook relative to key considerations about selecting the most appropriate sensor for one's need concerning these pollutants. Professional air quality researchers are trained to look for various attributes in monitoring technologies. While this document is limited in its scope concerning this area, basic information is provided that should assist citizen scientists and others in making the most appropriate choices. A major component of this guidebook is a discussion about data quality D considerations. Such topics as the need to calibrate sensors, determining the precision of the device's response, its response bias, and other performance characteristics are explained in practical terms. Examples of such performance characteristics determinations are provided to assist the user in understanding these important concepts. This guidebook does not attempt to answer every question the U.S. EPA has received about the selection and use of various sensor technologies. Sensor use must be considered on an individual basis and only following careful consideration of why the data is being collected and for what purpose. Extensive resources, nearly all easily obtained free through the internet, are highlighted in the document to assist potential sensor users in obtaining useful information as they consider the incorporation of sensor technology to meet a variety of applications.},

OAR-Stationary Source/Ambient Air-Almost all of our test procedures in Parts 60, 61, and 63 use calibration curves/lines to relate instrument response to analyte concentration or mass. Many of the methods contain quality assurance requirements that the analyst must meet for the acceptability of the calibration curve. Our QA requirements have generally not relied on correlation coefficients, but have followed an approach closer to that of Dr. Burrows where the response of each calibration standard must be within a specified range of the value predicted by the calibration line. Here is a typical example taken from Method 7 for the measurement of NO x emissions from Stationary Sources. In this case the analytical procedure is spectrophotometry in the visible range. 10.1.3 Spectrophotometer Calibration Quality Control. Multiply the absorbance value obtained for each standard by the K c factor (reciprocal of the least squares slope) to determine the distance each calibration point lies from the theoretical calibration line. The difference between the calculated concentration values and the actual concentrations (i.e., 100, 200, 300, and 400 $\mu$g NO 2) should be less than 7 percent for all standards. We need a quality assurance requirement for calibration curves/lines that would insure that testers are using calibration data to generate calibration curves that meet minimum standards for "goodness of fit."

The purpose of the present paper is to stress the relevance of weighting schemes for linear regression analysis and to show how this approach can be useful in the bioanalytical field. The steps to be taken in the study of the linear calibration approach are described. The application of weighting schemes was shown by using a high-performance liquid chromatography method for the determination of lamotrigine in biological fluids as a practical example. By using the WLSLR, the accuracy of the analytical method was improved at the lower end of the calibration curve. Bioanalytical methods data analysis was improved by using the WLSLR procedure. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) along with state, local, and tribal governments operate Federal Reference Method (FRM) and Federal Equivalent Method (FEM) instruments to assess compliance with US air pollution standards designed to protect human and ecosystem health. As the technological foundation of air pollution monitoring advances, new capabilities are being developed which can enhance our ability to determine ambient air pollutant concentrations. A new category of air pollution monitoring instruments called 'sensors' have emerged with a number of implications for the current US air monitoring strategy. Sensors have the potential to be used in compliance monitoring, however a number of considerations must be addressed. Fortunately EPA's FEM Program, under the 40 CFR Part 53 regulations, provides a clear roadmap for upgrading air pollution monitoring devices and this guidance can be applied to sensors. The paper will discuss how new technology is integrated into EPA's air monitoring program and how EPA's regulations can be used to incorporate sensors into the US air monitoring network.},

@article{Tian2016,
abstract = {In 2012, air pollution in both cities and rural areas was esti- mated to have caused 3.7 million premature deaths, 88{\%} of those in at-risk communities. The primary pollutant was small airborne particulate matter of 10 microns or less in diameter, which led to the development of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. In response, we developed MyPart, the first personal, portable, and accurate particle sensor under {\$}50 capable of distinguishing and counting differently sized particles. We demonstrate how MyPart offers substantial enhancements over most existing air particle sensors by simultaneously improving accessibility, flexibility, portability, and accuracy. We de- scribe the evolution and implementation of the sensor design, demonstrate its performance across twenty everyday urban environments versus a calibrated instrument, and conduct a preliminary user study to report on the overall user experience of MyPart. We also present a novel smart-phone visualization interface and a series of simple form factor adaptations of our design.},

abstract = {Hazardous chemicals escape to the environment by a number of natural and/or anthropogenic activities and may cause adverse effects on
human health and the environment. Increased combustion of fossil fuels in the last century is responsible for the progressive change in the atmospheric
composition. Air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds
(VOCs), ozone (O3), heavy metals, and respirable particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), differ in their chemical composition, reaction properties,
emission, time of disintegration and ability to diffuse in long or short distances. Air pollution has both acute and chronic effects on human
health, affecting a number of different systems and organs. It ranges from minor upper respiratory irritation to chronic respiratory and heart
disease, lung cancer, acute respiratory infections in children and chronic bronchitis in adults, aggravating pre-existing heart and lung disease,
or asthmatic attacks. In addition, short- and long-term exposures have also been linked with premature mortality and reduced life expectancy.
These effects of air pollutants on human health and their mechanism of action are briefly discussed.},

@article{Soni2016,
abstract = {With the rapid increase in numbers of private vehicles on the road, many transportation related issues like congestion, crashes and injuries, pollution, noise etc. have grown very rapidly. Urban settlements like core CBD and heritage town, which were planned for NMT and pedestrians, are worst affected. Environment, in such areas, has degraded to the extent that people do not wish to visit these areas anymore. On another hand, these areas have very significant role in economy and identity of the city. Due to unavailability of space and socioeconomic system, only feasible way to upgrade mobility and environment in such special areas is to pedestrianize them. Pedestrianization of the congested street is a very effective, low-cost and sustainable solution. Other than congestion reduction, Pedestrianization has numerous benefits. These list of benefits can be used to advocate Pedestrianization of any street. It can also help in estimating the cost to benefit ratio of such schemes. The first part of this paper summarize various benefits of Pedestrianization from the experience of Pedestrianization scheme around the globe and various researches conducted on its impact. These Benefits can be separated in various categories based on impacts on Transportation, Society, Environment, Economics, and Health. The second part of the paper list down various warrants that can be used as the indicators for the need of Pedestrianization in an area. These warrants can also be used as justification to pedestrianize an area. This paper will help various urban policy makers, land-use and transportation planner, environmentalists and citizens etc. in decision making to solve various urban issues related to transportation.},
