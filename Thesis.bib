abstract = {Highly hazardous pesticides may have acute or chronic toxic effects and pose particular risk to children. Their widespread use has caused health problems and fatalities in many parts of the world, often as a result of occupational exposure and accidental or intentional poisonings. Environmental contamination can also result in human exposure through consumption of residues of pesticides in food and, possibly, drinking-water. Although developed countries have sophisticated systems already in place to register pesticides and control their trade and use, this is not always the case elsewhere. Guidance and legal frameworks on the use, management and trade of pesticides—including highly hazardous pesticides—as well as proper storage and handling are available from international organizations and international conventions; these should be implemented globally.},

To detect the environmental conditions in remote places, monitoring applications employ the sensor networks to detect conditions, context models to understand phenomena, and computing technology to process the large volumes of data. In this paper, we present an air pollution monitoring system to provide alarm messages about potentially dangerous areas with sensor data analysis. We design the data analysis steps to understand the detected air pollution regions and levels. The analyzed data is used to track the pollution and to give an alarm. This implemented monitoring system is used to mitigate the damages caused by air pollution.},

@article{Williams2014,
abstract = {This Air Sensor Guidebook has been developed by the U.S. EPA to assist those interested in potentially using lower cost air quality sensor technologies for air quality measurements. Its development was in direct response to a request for such a document following a recent scientific conference (Apps and Sensors for Air Pollution-2012). Low cost air quality sensors ({\$}100-{\$}2500) are now commercially available in a wide variety of designs and capabilities. This is an emerging technology area and one that is quickly evolving. Even so, their availability has resulted in questions from many as to how they might be used appropriately. This document attempts to provide useful information concerning some of those questions. The use of sensors to meet a variety of needs ranging from educational programs to professional research data collections is described. A select market survey is provided here to inform the reader about the cost range and performance capability of commercially available air quality sensors. The document provides background information on common air pollutants such as those defined as “criteria pollutants” as well as select others. Useful information is provided in the guidebook relative to key considerations about selecting the most appropriate sensor for one's need concerning these pollutants. Professional air quality researchers are trained to look for various attributes in monitoring technologies. While this document is limited in its scope concerning this area, basic information is provided that should assist citizen scientists and others in making the most appropriate choices. A major component of this guidebook is a discussion about data quality D considerations. Such topics as the need to calibrate sensors, determining the precision of the device's response, its response bias, and other performance characteristics are explained in practical terms. Examples of such performance characteristics determinations are provided to assist the user in understanding these important concepts. This guidebook does not attempt to answer every question the U.S. EPA has received about the selection and use of various sensor technologies. Sensor use must be considered on an individual basis and only following careful consideration of why the data is being collected and for what purpose. Extensive resources, nearly all easily obtained free through the internet, are highlighted in the document to assist potential sensor users in obtaining useful information as they consider the incorporation of sensor technology to meet a variety of applications.},

However, improper calibration might cause a significant bias of the analytical results from the real (certified) value. Standard Gaussian line- ar regression is the most frequently used mathematical approach for esti- mation of calibration function parameters. In the present article are dis- cussed some not quite popular, but highly recommended in certain cases methods for parameter estimation, such as: weighted regression, orthogo- nal regression, robust regression, bracketing calibration etc. Some useful approximations are also presented. Special attention is paid to the statistical criteria which to be used for selection of proper calibration model. Standard UV-VIS spectrometric procedure for determination of phos- phates in water was used as a practical example. Several different ap- proaches for estimation of the contribution of calibration to the general un- certainty of the analytical result are presented and compared. 1.},

As the technological foundation of air pollution monitoring advances, new capabilities are being developed which can enhance our ability to determine ambient air pollutant concentrations. A new category of air pollution monitoring instruments called 'sensors' have emerged with a number of implications for the current US air monitoring strategy. Sensors have the potential to be used in compliance monitoring, however a number of considerations must be addressed. Fortunately EPA's FEM Program, under the 40 CFR Part 53 regulations, provides a clear roadmap for upgrading air pollution monitoring devices and this guidance can be applied to sensors. The paper will discuss how new technology is integrated into EPA's air monitoring program and how EPA's regulations can be used to incorporate sensors into the US air monitoring network.},

abstract = {Hazardous chemicals escape to the environment by a number of natural and/or anthropogenic activities and may cause adverse effects on
human health and the environment. Increased combustion of fossil fuels in the last century is responsible for the progressive change in the atmospheric
composition. Air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds
(VOCs), ozone (O3), heavy metals, and respirable particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), differ in their chemical composition, reaction properties,
emission, time of disintegration and ability to diffuse in long or short distances. Air pollution has both acute and chronic effects on human
health, affecting a number of different systems and organs. It ranges from minor upper respiratory irritation to chronic respiratory and heart
disease, lung cancer, acute respiratory infections in children and chronic bronchitis in adults, aggravating pre-existing heart and lung disease,
or asthmatic attacks. In addition, short- and long-term exposures have also been linked with premature mortality and reduced life expectancy.
These effects of air pollutants on human health and their mechanism of action are briefly discussed.},

A multi-parameter algorithm was used to correct for the impact of environmental conditions on the electrochemical sensors for carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pollutants. The field evaluation in an urban roadside environment in comparison to designated monitors showed good agreement with measurement error within 5{\%} of the pollutant concentrations. Multiple sets of the developed system were then deployed in the Hong Kong Marathon 2015 forming a sensor-based network along the marathon route. Real-time air pollution concentration data were wirelessly transmitted and the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) for the Green Marathon was calculated, which were broadcast to the public on an hourly basis. The route-specific sensor network showed somewhat different pollutant patterns than routine air monitoring, indicating the immediate impact of traffic control during the marathon on the roadside air quality. The study is one of the first applications of a next generation sensor network in international sport events, and it demonstrated the usefulness of the emerging sensor-based air monitoring technology in rapid network deployment to supplement existing air monitoring.},

abstract = {Urban air pollution is a major concern in many cities worldwide. Atmospheric pollutants are responsible for health problems ranging from asthma to cancer. Air pollution also causes environmental damages. Monitoring airborne pollutants is of utmost importance to reliably assess the impact of air pollution on the human health, enable urban planners to craft and accurately evaluate new policies, and increase public awareness. Nowadays, air pollution is monitored by networks of highly accurate but fixed measurement stations. Hence, the gathered data has a low spatial resolution and can not be used to assess the spatial variability of pollutants in detail. As a result, little is known about the spatial distribution of air pollutants in urban environments. In this thesis, we tackle this challenge and derive fine-grained intraurban pollution maps valuable for a range of applications. We use compact low-cost sensors installed on top of public transport vehicles to obtain a high spatial measurement resolution within a large urban area. We develop algorithms that allow us to accurately monitor the phenomena of interest despite using noisy, low-cost sensors. Finally, we use the measurements to derive air pollution maps with a high spatial and temporal resolution},

In this paper, we are proposing the deployment of WSN sensor nodes in public transport buses for the constant monitoring of air pollution. The data regarding the air pollution particles such as emissions, smoke, and other pollutants will be collected via sensors on the public transport bus and the data will be aggregated and transmitted to the nearest sink node. Using the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) the collected data will be uploaded on the cloud server also called as the IoT cloud where a large amount of the data is stored.

@article{Hu2015,
abstract = {Air quality and pollution monitoring services are provided by many countries and cities. However, individuals are more concerned about personal exposure and dosage, which can rarely be estimated due to the low spatial resolution of air pollution data and lack of personal data. In recent years, an increasing number of research groups, including ours, have focused on increasing the spatial resolution of air pollution data using ubiquitous sensor networks. These works did raise the spatial granularity compared with data from fixed air pollution monitoring sites. In this paper, we combine air pollution and human energy expenditure data to give individuals real-time personal air pollution exposure estimates. In particular, this paper describes our experiences with developing a personal air pollution exposure estimation system utilising participatory air pollution monitoring system and energy expenditure data collected from wearable activity sensors. Our system and applications will benefit the understanding of the relationship between air pollution exposure and personal health. We also conducted a trial to get a full day's air pollution inhalation dosage for one participant, and applied multiple data mining techniques to find out associations between activity mode, location, and the inhaled pollution. Results show that sleep, having meals, working in a campus, and general home activities like reading books will lead to a low air pollution dosage, while working out, walking and driving will cause higher inhaled dose. Furthermore, classification results in our study based on activity modes, locations and dosage data which is collected in the trial show that up to 94{\%} classification accuracy can be achieved.

abstract = {In recent years several research groups, including ours, have demonstrated participatory systems that use wearable or vehicle-mounted portable units coupled with smartphones to crowdsource urban air pollution data from lay users. These systems have shown remarkable improvement in spatial granularity over government-operated monitoring systems, leading to better mapping and understanding of urban air pollution, at relatively low cost. In this paper we extend the paradigm to personalize the consumption of data by individuals. Specifically, we combine the pollution concentrations obtained from participatory systems with the individuals on-body activity monitors to estimate the personal inhalation dosage of air pollution. We show that the individuals activity, such as jogging, cycling, or driving, impacts their dosage, and develop an app that gives them this personalised information. Our system is a step towards enabling medical inferencing of the impact of air pollution on individual health.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ventilatory compensation point (VCP) is an exercise threshold which has been used in the design of training programs in sports medicine and rehabilitation. We recently demonstrated that changes in the slope of the minute ventilation to heart rate relationship ($\Delta$V˙E/$\Delta$HR) can be utilized for estimation of the VCP during incremental exercise at sea level (SL). We hypothesized that in hypoxic conditions, such as high altitude (HA), VCP can be also reliably estimated by $\Delta$V˙E/$\Delta$HR.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: At SL and on immediate ascent to HA (5,050 m), six healthy subjects (42 ± 14 SD years) performed a maximal incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer; O2 uptake (V˙O2), CO2 output (V˙CO2), V˙E, and HR were measured breath-by-breath. The $\Delta$V˙E/$\Delta$HR method for VCP estimation was compared to the standard method using the ventilatory equivalent for CO2 (V˙E/V˙CO2) and end-tidal PCO2 (PETCO2). The $\Delta$V˙E/$\Delta$HR slope values below (S1) and above (S2) VCP were computed by linear regression analysis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A significant difference between S1 and S2 was observed, at SL and HA, for both the $\Delta$V˙E/$\Delta$HR and V˙E/V˙CO2 methods for VCP estimation. A good agreement between the two methods ($\Delta$V˙E/$\Delta$HR vs. V˙E/V˙CO2) was found for both environmental conditions; the mean difference ± 2 SD of V˙O2 at VCP (VCP-V˙O2) was -22 ± 112 ml/min at SL and 39 ± 81 ml/min at HA. The VCP-V˙O2 was significantly lower at HA compared to SL; in addition, S1 and S2 mean values were significantly higher at HA compared to SL.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: At HA, VCP may be reliably estimated by the $\Delta$V˙E/$\Delta$HR method.},

@article{Kanhere2013,
abstract = {The recent wave of sensor-rich, Internet-enabled, smart mobile devices such as the Apple iPhone has opened the door for a novel paradigm for monitoring the urban landscape known as participatory sensing. Using this paradigm, ordinary citizens can collect multi-modal data streams from the surrounding environment using their mobile devices and share the same using existing communication infrastructure (e.g., 3G service or WiFi access points). The data contributed from multiple participants can be combined to build a spatiotemporal view of the phenomenon of interest and also to extract important community statistics. Given the ubiquity of mobile phones and the high density of people in metropolitan areas, participatory sensing can achieve an unprecedented level of coverage in both space and time for observing events of interest in urban spaces. Several exciting participatory sensing applications have emerged in recent years. For example, GPS traces uploaded by drivers and passengers can be used to generate real time traffic statistics. Similarly, street-level audio samples collected by pedestrians can be aggregated to create a citywide noise map. In this advanced seminar, we will provide a comprehensive overview of this new and exciting paradigm and outline the major research challenges.},

abstract = {Spatial estimations are increasingly used to estimate geocoded ambient particulate matter (PM) concentrations in epidemiologic studies because measures of daily PM concentrations are unavailable in most U.S. locations. This study was conducted to a) assess the feasibility of large-scale kriging estimations of daily residential-level ambient PM concentrations, b) perform and compare cross-validations of different kriging models, c) contrast three popular kriging approaches, and d) calculate SE of the kriging estimations. We used PM data for PM with aerodynamic diameter {\textless}/= 10 microm (PM10) and aerodynamic diameter {\textless}/= 2.5 microm (PM2.5) from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the year 2000. Kriging estimations were performed at 94,135 geocoded addresses of Women's Health Initiative study participants using the ArcView geographic information system. We developed a semiautomated program to enable large-scale daily kriging estimation and assessed validity of semivariogram models using prediction error (PE) , standardized prediction error (SPE) , root mean square standardized (RMSS) , and SE of the estimated PM. National- and regional-scale kriging performed satisfactorily, with the former slightly better. The average PE, SPE, and RMSS of daily PM10 semivariograms using regular ordinary kriging with a spherical model were 0.0629, -0.0011, and 1.255 microg/m3, respectively ; the average SE of the estimated residential-level PM10 was 27.36 microg/m3. The values for PM2.5 were 0.049, 0.0085, 1.389, and 4.13 microg/m3, respectively. Lognormal ordinary kriging yielded a smaller average SE and effectively eliminated out-of-range predicted values compared to regular ordinary kriging. Semiautomated daily kriging estimations and semivariogram cross-validations are feasible on a national scale. Lognormal ordinary kriging with a spherical model is valid for estimating daily ambient PM at geocoded residential addresses.},

Though air pollution imposes significant health costs on the urban community globally, to-day's published data on pollution concentrations is spatially too sparse, and does not allow for sufficiently accurate estimation of exposures for (potentially mobile) individuals in order to make medical inferences. The HazeWatch project described in this paper uses several low-cost mobile sensor units attached to vehicles to measure air pollution concentrations, and users' mobile phones to tag and upload the data in real time. The greater spatial granularity of data thus collected enables creation of pollution maps of metropolitan Sydney viewable in real-time over the web, as well as personalized apps that show the individual's exposure history and allow for route planning to reduce future exposure. We share the insights we obtained from building and trialling such a system in Sydney, and highlight challenges that can be addressed collaboratively by groups developing similar systems world-wide.},

Alternatively, wireless sensor network offers a comprehensive platform for capturing the surrounding environmental information using mobile sensing nodes, e.g., the OpenSense project [2] in Switzerland deploying air quality sensors like CO on public transports like buses and trams. The two sensing platforms are typically isolated from each other. In this paper, we build ExposureSense, a rich mobile participatory sensing infrastructure that integrates the two independent sensing paradigms. ExposureSense is able to monitor people's daily activities as well to compute a reasonable estimation of pollution exposure in their daily life. Besides using external sensor networks, ExposureSense also supports pluggable sensors (e.g., O3) to further enrich air quality data using mobile participatory sensing with smartphones.},

abstract = {Plastic debris were collected from eight beaches around San Diego County, California. Debris collected include: pre-production pellets and post-consumer plastics including fragments, polystyrene (PS) foam, and rubber. A total of n=2453 pieces were collected ranging from {\textless}5mm to 50mm in size. The plastic pieces were separated by type, location, and appearance and analyzed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its breakdown products, and chlordanes. PAH concentrations ranged from 30ngg(-1) to 1900ngg(-1), PCBs from non-detect to 47ngg(-1), chlordanes from 1.8ngg(-1) to 60ngg(-1), and DDTs from non-detect to 76ngg(-1). Consistently higher PAH concentrations found in PS foam samples (300-1900ngg(-1)) led us to examine unexposed PS foam packaging materials and PS virgin pellets. Unexposed PS foam contained higher concentrations of PAHs (240-1700ngg(-1)) than PS virgin pellets (12-15ngg(-1)), suggesting that PAHs may be produced during manufacturing. Temporal trends of debris were investigated at one site, Ocean Beach, where storm events and beach maintenance were found to be important variables influencing debris present at a given time.},

Air pollution is considered as the main cause for the majority of deaths and suffering with chronic diseases. To address this issue, we believe, active participation from public on collecting and interpreting data, educating to change the behavior of individuals and industries, and helping to control and manage pollution sources effectively is crucial. Fortunately, this goal appears to be achievable due to recent revolution of electronic and computing technologies. It is possible that small, portable, and off-the-shelf pollution sensors along with low power processors and wireless communication modules can be bought at low cost. Also, the availability of open source software for general and specific purposes is consistently increasing. What is needed is a system framework on how to build a low cost portable pollution monitoring system and install necessary open source software modules to make the system operational with least effort and technical knowledge. Contributing to achieve this task is the objective of this work.

abstract = {One of our era's greatest scourges is air pollution, on account not only of its impact on climate change but also its impact on public and individual health due to increasing morbidity and mortality. There are many pollutants that are major factors in disease in humans. Among them, Particulate Matter (PM), particles of variable but very small diameter, penetrate the respiratory system via inhalation, causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, reproductive and central nervous system dysfunctions, and cancer. Despite the fact that ozone in the stratosphere plays a protective role against ultraviolet irradiation, it is harmful when in high concentration at ground level, also affecting the respiratory and cardiovascular system. Furthermore, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), dioxins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are all considered air pollutants that are harmful to humans. Carbon monoxide can even provoke direct poisoning when breathed in at high levels. Heavy metals such as lead, when absorbed into the human body, can lead to direct poisoning or chronic intoxication, depending on exposure. Diseases occurring from the aforementioned substances include principally respiratory problems such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiolitis, and also lung cancer, cardiovascular events, central nervous system dysfunctions, and cutaneous diseases. Last but not least, climate change resulting from environmental pollution affects the geographical distribution of many infectious diseases, as do natural disasters. The only way to tackle this problem is through public awareness coupled with a multidisciplinary approach by scientific experts; national and international organizations must address the emergence of this threat and propose sustainable solutions.},

abstract = {Micro-climate monitoring usually requires deploying a large number of measurement tools. By adopting vehicular wireless sensor networks (VSNs), we can use fewer tools to achieve fine-grained monitoring. This work proposes a VSN architecture to realize micro-climate monitoring based on GSM short messages and availability of GPS receivers on vehicles. We demonstrate our prototype of a ZigBee-based car network to monitor the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) gas in areas of interest. The reported data are sent to a server, which is integrated with Google Maps as our user interface. Since mobility of these vehicles is not controllable and sending short messages incurs charges, we also design an on-demand approach to adjust vehicles' reporting rates to balance between the micro-climate accuracy and the communication cost.},

In response, we developed MyPart, the first personal, portable, and accurate particle sensor under {\$}50 capable of distinguishing and counting differently sized particles. We demonstrate how MyPart offers substantial enhancements over most existing air particle sensors by simultaneously improving accessibility, flexibility, portability, and accuracy.

@article{Fang2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.In the U.S., people spend approximately 90 percent of their time indoors. Unfortunately, indoor air quality (IAQ) may be two to five times worse than the air outdoors, and is often overlooked. Existing IAQ monitoring technologies focus on IAQ measurements and visualization. However, the lack of information about the pollution sources as well as the seriousness of the pollution makes people feel powerless and frustrated, resulting in the ignorance of the polluted air at their homes. In this work, we fill this critical gap by presenting AirSense, an intelligent home-based IAQ sensing system that is able to automatically detect pollution events, identify pollution sources, estimate personal exposure to indoor air pollution, and provide actionable suggestions to help people improve IAQ. We have deployed AirSense at five homes to evaluate its performance and investigate how users interact with it. We demonstrate that AirSense can accurately detect pollution events, identify pollution sources, and forecast IAQ information within five minutes in both controlled and real-world settings. We further show the great potential of AirSense in increasing users' awareness of IAQ and helping them better manage IAQ at their homes.},

@article{Wilson1997,
abstract = {Fine particles and coarse particles are defined in terms of the modal structure of particle size distributions typically observed in the atmosphere. Differences between the various mdes are discussed. The fractions of fine and coarse particles collected in specific size ranges, such as total suspended particulate matter (TSP), PM10, PM2.5, and PM(10-2.5), are shown. Correlations of 24-h concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and PM(10-2.5) at the same site show that, in Philadelphia and St. Louis, PM2.5 is highly correlated with PM10 but poorly correlated with PM(10-2.5). Among sites distributed across these urban areas, the site–to–site correlations of 24– PM concentrations are high for PM2.5 but not for PM(10–2.5). This indicates that a PM measurement at a central monitor can serve as a better indicator of the community–wide concentration of fine particles than of coarse particles. The fraction of ambient outdoor particles found suspended indoors is greater for fine particles than for coarse particles because of the difference in indoor lifetimes. Consideration of these relationships leads to the hypothesis that the statistical associations found between daily PM indicators and health outcomes may be the result of variations in the fine particle component of the atmospheric aerosol, not of variations in the coarse component. As a result, epidemiologic studies using PM10 or TSP may provide more useful information on the acute health effects of fine particles than coarse particles. Fine and coarse particles are separate classes of pollutants and should be measured separately in research and epidemiologic studies. PM2.5 and PM(10–2.5) are indicators or surrogates, but not measurements, of fine and coarse particles. {\textcopyright} 1997 Air {\&} Waste Management Association.},

@article{Salonen2019,
abstract = {Background: Although nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of the most common air pollutants encountered indoors, and extensive literature has examined the link between NO2 exposure and duration causing adverse respiratory effects in susceptible populations, information about global and local exposure to NO2 in different indoor environments is limited. To synthesize the existing knowledge, this review analyzes the magnitude of and the trends in global and local exposure to NO2 in schools and offices, and the factors that control exposure. Methods: For the literature review, Web of Science, SCOPUS, Google Scholar, and PubMed were searched using 42 search terms and their combinations to identify manuscripts, reports, and directives published between 1971 and 2019. The search was then extended to the reference lists of relevant articles. Results: The calculated median, as well as the mean, concentration of NO2 in school (median 21.1 $\mu$g/m3; mean 29.4 $\mu$g/m3) and office settings (median 22.7 $\mu$g/m3; mean 25.1 $\mu$g/m3) was well below the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline of 40 $\mu$g/m3 for the annual mean NO2 concentration. However, a large range of average concentrations of NO2 were reported, from 6.00 to 68.5 $\mu$g/m3 and from 3.40 to 56.5 $\mu$g/m3 for school and office environments, respectively, indicating situations where the WHO guidelines are exceeded. Outdoor levels of NO2 are a reliable predictor of indoor NO2 levels across seasons, with mean and median Indoor/Outdoor (I/O) ratios of 0.9 and 0.7 in school and 0.9 and 0.8 in office environments, respectively. The absence of major indoor NO2 emission sources and NO2 sinks, including chemical reactions and deposition, are the reasons for lower indoor NO2 concentrations. During the winter, outdoor NO2 concentrations are generally higher than during the summer. In addition, various building and indoor environment characteristics, such as type of ventilation, air exchange rates, airtightness of the envelope, furnishing and surface characteristics of the building, location of the building (urban versus suburban and proximity to traffic routes), as well as occupants' behavior (such as opening windows), have been statistically significantly associated with indoor NO2 levels in school and office environments. Conclusions: Indoor exposure to NO2 from the infiltration of ambient air can be significant in urban areas, and in the case of high traffic volume. Although reducing transportation emissions is challenging, there are several easier means to reduce indoor NO2 concentrations, including a ventilation strategy with suitable filters; location planning of new schools, classrooms, and ventilating windows or intakes; traffic planning (location and density); and reducing the use of NO2-releasing indoor sources.},

abstract = {With the rapid increase in numbers of private vehicles on the road, many transportation related issues like congestion, crashes and injuries, pollution, noise etc. have grown very rapidly. Urban settlements like core CBD and heritage town, which were planned for NMT and pedestrians, are worst affected. Environment, in such areas, has degraded to the extent that people do not wish to visit these areas anymore. On another hand, these areas have very significant role in economy and identity of the city. Due to unavailability of space and socioeconomic system, only feasible way to upgrade mobility and environment in such special areas is to pedestrianize them. Pedestrianization of the congested street is a very effective, low-cost and sustainable solution. Other than congestion reduction, Pedestrianization has numerous benefits. These list of benefits can be used to advocate Pedestrianization of any street. It can also help in estimating the cost to benefit ratio of such schemes. The first part of this paper summarize various benefits of Pedestrianization from the experience of Pedestrianization scheme around the globe and various researches conducted on its impact. These Benefits can be separated in various categories based on impacts on Transportation, Society, Environment, Economics, and Health.

abstract = {Sensor networks are currently an active research area mainly due to the potential of their applications. In this paper we investigate the use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) for air pollution monitoring in Mauritius. With the fast growing industrial activities on the island, the problem of air pollution is becoming a major concern for the health of the population. We proposed an innovative system named Wireless Sensor Network Air Pollution Monitoring System (WAPMS) to monitor air pollution in Mauritius through the use of wireless sensors deployed in huge numbers around the island. The proposed system makes use of an Air Quality Index (AQI) which is presently not available in Mauritius. In order to improve the efficiency of WAPMS, we have designed and implemented a new data aggregation algorithm named Recursive Converging Quartiles (RCQ). The algorithm is used to merge data to eliminate duplicates, filter out invalid readings and summarise them into a simpler form which significantly reduce the amount of data to be transmitted to the sink and thus saving energy. For better power management we used a hierarchical routing protocol in WAPMS and caused the motes to sleep during idle time.},

@article{Kuula2017,
abstract = {Inexpensive aerosol sensors have been considered as a complementary option to address the issue of expensive but low spatial coverage air quality monitoring networks. However, the accuracy and response characteristics of these sensors is poorly documented. In this study, inexpensive Shinyei PPD42NS and PPD60PV sensors were evaluated using a novel laboratory evaluation method. A continuously changing monodisperse size distribution of particles was generated using a Vibrating Orifice Aerosol Generator. Furthermore, the laboratory results were validated in a field experiment. The laboratory tests showed that both of the sensors responded to particulate mass (PM) concentration stimulus, rather than number concentration. The highest detection efficiency for the PPD42NS was within particle size range of 2.5–4 m, and the respective optimal size range for the PPD60PV was 0.7–1 m. The field test yielded high PM correlations (R2 = 0.962 and R2 = 0.986) for viable detection ranges of 1.6–5 and 0.3–1.6 m, when compared to a medium cost optical dust monitor. As the size distribution of atmospheric particles tends to be bimodal, it is likely that indicatively valid results could be obtained for the PM10–2.5 size fraction (particulate mass in size range 2.5–10 m) with the PPD42NS sensor. Respectively, the PPD60PV could possibly be used to measure the PM2.5 size fraction (particulate mass in size below 2.5 m).},

@misc{Williams2013,
abstract = {Lower cost sensors ({\$}100-500) represent a unique class of air monitoring devices which may provide for more ubiquitous pollutant monitoring. They vary widely in design and measure pollutants ranging from ozone, particulate matter, to volatile organic compounds, among others. Many of these sensors provide for continuous air quality measurements and wireless data transmission. However, data quality from such devices is a concern. Three straw-man approaches to improve upon the usability of such measurements were considered as part of the 2013 Air Sensors Workshop. Findings from the breakout devoted to this topic are summarized. The 2013 Air Sensors Workshop had a primary goal of moving past previous expert discussions on discovery of low cost sensor technologies (1,2) and how data from such sensors could be used to their full advantage. One key concern about these technologies was the uncertainty of their data in that often no direct means of sensor calibration was being provided by the sensor developer. As explained further in this article, there are a multitude of reasons for this lack of what most monitoring experts would consider to be a necessary feature of any air quality sensor (user response calibration). This leaves the user (often private citizens with no scientific training) with collecting data which may or may not be accurate or even realistic. To help frame a discussion about this concern and how it might be resolved, three straw-man calibration approaches were developed prior to the workshop. They were provided to registrants in advance for their consideration. Subsequent breakout panels consisting of more than 40 experts having backgrounds in sensor development, environmental monitoring, regulatory affairs, data signal processing, or citizen science then critically examined each straw-man approach. The value of each approach was considered and summary conclusions established based upon the likelihood of success of each approach and/or its acceptance by the lower cost sensor user community. Key features of each approach are defined in Table 1 and discussed in depth below.},

@article{Almeida2002,
abstract = {When the assumption of homoscedasticity is not met for analytical data, a simple and effective way to counteract the greater influence of the greater concentrations on the fitted regression line is to use weighted least squares linear regression (WLSLR). The purpose of the present paper is to stress the relevance of weighting schemes for linear regression analysis and to show how this approach can be useful in the bioanalytical field. The steps to be taken in the study of the linear calibration approach are described. The application of weighting schemes was shown by using a high-performance liquid chromatography method for the determination of lamotrigine in biological fluids as a practical example. By using the WLSLR, the accuracy of the analytical method was improved at the lower end of the calibration curve. Bioanalytical methods data analysis was improved by using the WLSLR procedure. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},
